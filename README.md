Inspired by DataProfessor's Bioinformatics tutorials, I've condensed the courses into:
• 2 open source data files (bioactivity and molecular descriptors)
• a single jupyter notebook to perform computational drug discovery

Notebook leverages machine learning using a LazyRegressor to build multiple base models for convenience.
